            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Bret Combast is some guy who thinks about computers and other things with no real understanding of the
            consequences of these thoughts. Because of this he's been a DJ, a gamer, a linux admin, a LAMP stack developer,
            a writer, and most recently a Cloud Engineer.</p>
